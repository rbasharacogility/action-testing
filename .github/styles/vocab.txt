# TBD
#   All rules should define the following header keys:
#
#   `extends` indicates the extension point being used (see below for information
#   on the possible values).
# extends: existence
#   `message` is shown to the user when the rule is broken.
#
#   Many extension points accept format specifiers (%s), which are replaced by
#   extracted values. See the extension-specific sections below for more details.
# message: "Consider removing '%s'"
#   `level` assigns the rule's severity.
#
#   The accepted values are suggestion, warning, and error.
# level: warning
#   `scope` specifies where this rule should apply -- e.g., headings, sentences, etc.
#
#   See the Markup section for more information on scoping.
# scope: heading
#   `link` gives the source for this rule.
# link: 'https://errata.ai/'
#   The number of times this rule should raise an alert.
#
#   By default, there is no limit.
# limit: 1
